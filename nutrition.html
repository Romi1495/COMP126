                <h1>What to Feed my Cat?</h1>
                <p> A cat's nutrition is the key to ensuring the grow up to lead a long, healthy and happy life! While they may attempt to eat everything you take a bite of, including cheese pizza, it is important to make sure you are mindful of what you are feeding your cat. </p>
                <p> The difference in a few cents per can of food can end up meaning a lot down the road, so make sure you pay attention to the labels and research! </p>

                <h3>Dry Food</h3>
                <p>For your cat's dry food, you should make sure to look for brands and flavors that offer grain-free options. Cats need a lot of protein, so prioritizing dry foods that have animal proteins as the main ingredient is a great strategy. For example, my choice of dry food for my cat is Tiki Cat's Chicken-based dry food. While slightly more expensive than other brands, it guarantees a grain-free and high protein meal for my cat!</p>

                <h3>Wet Food</h3>
                <p>Cats are actually not that great at staying hydrated by drinking water, so they find a majority of their hydration through eating wet foods. This means that consistently feeding your cat wet food in addition to the dry kibble is extremely important! I even tend to add some water to my cat's cans of wet food to make sure she is staying hydrated. Similar to dry food, it is important to prioritize high protein content and grain-free options! My wet food of choice for my cat is Purina Pro Plan canned wet food (chicken, turkey, etc.)</p>
