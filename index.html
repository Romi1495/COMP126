                <p>Here you will find everything you need to know to take care of your feline friend. From nutrition to grooming and more.</p>

            <h3> Some basics to start off with </h3>
            <p> While cats make amazing pets and are not the hardest to take care of, there are some important fundamental things to understand before you make the decision to get a cat! </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-5">
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>Adoption vs. Buying</h3>
                <p> While many people get their cats from specific breeders, there are countless cats without homes in adoption centers. I adopted my cat from a local PetSmart, and she had a rough past of being a stray cat and being adopted but brought back previously. However, she has been a very loving and appreciative cat, so you should not be scared of adoption!</p>
                <p> On the other hand, my brother bought both of his cats from a specific breeder. He had to pay significantly more than I did for his cats, but because they were raised in a loving home from essentially day 1 they took essentially no time to get comfortable around people. </p>
                <p> In summary, there is no "wrong" answer when it comes to the decision between adopting and buying a cat, both are great options but mostly depend on your situation and goals</p>

                <h3>Basic Checklist</h3>
                <p>Are you planning on getting a cat? Here are some essentials you need to be ready to provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Litter Box & Mat </li>
                    <li> Water Fountain </li>
                    <li> Food Bowl </li>
                    <li> Scratching Posts </li>
                    <li> Toys </li>
                    <li> Cat Tree </li>
                    <li> Visits to the Vet </li>
                </ul>
                <p> While cats are much easier to take care of than dogs, make sure you are ready to put in the upfront effort to create a comfortable living environment for your cat! There are many essential things they need to be happy, but after that it isn't too hard to maintain a happy kitty</p>

                <h3>Mindfulness of Others</h3>
                <p>While you may be ceratin that you want to get a cat, it is important to make sure that other people in your living area such as family members or roommates are also on board! Some people have allergies to cats, meaning that you need to be much more mindful about the type of cat you are getting</p>
                <p>However, if allergies are the only thing holding them back then I have great news! There are multiple cat breeds such as the Maine Coon that shed less or are even hypoallergenic, meaning that they won't bother someone who is normally allergic to cats!</p>
