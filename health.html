                <h1>What to Feed my Cat?</h1>
                <p> A cat's nutrition is the key to ensuring the grow up to lead a long, healthy and happy life! While they may attempt to eat everything you take a bite of, including cheese pizza, it is important to make sure you are mindful of what you are feeding your cat. </p>
                <p> The difference in a few cents per can of food can end up meaning a lot down the road, so make sure you pay attention to the labels and research! </p>

                <h3>Grooming</h3>
                <p>Cats are very clean animals and do an amazing job of keeping themselves clean through grooming. They love to keep their nails trimmed and sharp by scratching on things, so it is very important to provide good, scratchable surfaces like posts and boards! If you don't, they might take it upon themselves to use your furniture for their scratching needs.</p>

                <h3>Healthcare</h3>
                <p>Visits to the vet are extremely important to make sure your cat is staying healthy and safe, and your vet can provide the best context-specific advice for you and your cat. It is important not to be scared of the vet and developing positive reinforcement with vet visits by giving your cat treats to make sure they don't make too much of a fuss. Proactive healthcare such as anti-parasite treatments is a vital part of your cat's health and will help to keep them safe.</p>
